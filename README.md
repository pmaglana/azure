<h1> Creating a Windows Virtual machine in Azure Portal </h1>
<h2> What are Virtual Machines </h2>

Virtual Machines are computer that runs inside another computer over the internet. You can install an operating system, run software, host websites, and perform tasks just like you would on a normal PC or server.

<h2> About this Project </h2>
The main objective of this project is to familiarize MS Azure's portal and environment, how Virtual Machine works and how to create one. Here, we will also learn how to connect to a VM using Remote Desktop.

<h2> Environment and Technology used </h2>

- Microsoft Azure
- Windows O.S
- Remote Desktop

<h2> Getting Started </h2>

<h3> 1. Create a free subscription or Pay As You Go subscription at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ </h3>
